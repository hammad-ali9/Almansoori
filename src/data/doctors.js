                a: "In the same way, we visit our Doctors for check-ups or when we are concerned about our health, it is important to check in mentally. The mind is an underestimated factor in overall health, from our thoughts, beliefs, behaviors, and approach to life. Counseling gives you a space where you can better understand yourself, and the resources that you can cultivate, and helps you design a vision for the kind of life you wish to lead."

                a: "Sessions are an hour long, and the frequency differs with each client. I always suggest starting with 1 to 4 consistent sessions. The first session is mainly exploratory, where you can share, ask questions, and better understand the process. After that, I recommend 4 consecutive weekly sessions for you to reliably assess your own progress. Change takes time and requires patience."

                q: "What can't I talk about in the sessions?",

You are encouraged to be open and transparent. This is a collaborative relationship, your input, opinions, feelings and thoughts are always encouraged."
